# Collection of LaTex stuff

This is my collection of useful latex scripts and tricks. The repository will be updated regularly when I got something new to share.


----------
### CodeHighlighting
Here you can find some useful scripts to add code to your latex document.


----------
### Misc
#### requirements.tex
This file contains a helper environment which helps to define product requirements using a table structure.
It is really easy to use and a lot easier to read than the build-in tabular tables.


#### fontys.bst
This is a latex citation style. It is an improved version of the standard citation-style alpha.
It generates the reference out of the first four letters of the authorÂ´s last name and the last two numbers form the date.


----------
### FullTemplate
This is a full latex template which I use for my college reports.

For a easy compilation, there is a Makefile available.
The Makefile support following targets:

 - woc - Without citation. Does not compile a biliography file. (default target)
 - wc - With citation. Does compile a bibliography file.
 - count - Gives an overview about the number of words.
 - clean - Deletes autogenerated files.
